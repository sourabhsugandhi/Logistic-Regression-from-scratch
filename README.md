######  This is the legendary Titanic dataset– the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself
######  use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
######  Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”
######  test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.
######  Using the patterns we’ll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.
